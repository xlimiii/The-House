# The House
python project

"The House" is a really simple paragraph driven game written in Python. 
It's our first programming project ever. We've created it during our first month of studying computer science.  
The game takes place in an abandoned house in Halloween. There are lots of interesting and frightening characters in its rooms. 
It was originally written in python 2 but due to our great sentiment for the project, we decided to do its migration to python 3.
